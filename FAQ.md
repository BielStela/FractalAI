# Frequently Asked Questions

In this document, we will be addressing the most common questions people send to us.

## I want to train a Neural Network. Can I use FAI for that?

Although we are not addressing any kind of learning process in this repository, we believe that FAI
could be use to boost the performance of RL Agents. There are suggestions on how to use FMC and
Swarm Wave to improve RL agents in the [Introduction to FAI](https://github.com/FragileTheory/FractalAI/blob/master/introduction_to_fai.md#combining-fai-and-rl)
document.
